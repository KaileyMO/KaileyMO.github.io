## Project description

This program is a 2-D puzzle game created in Java code. It contains three levels; each level contains a yellow key that the player must unlock by completing each level's unique puzzle. Once the player collects the level's key, a black door appears and the player goes through the door and to the next level. The player completes these puzzles by moving left, right, and jumping like in typical platformer games.

Controls:
Move left- A
Move right- D
Jump- W
Open menu- Shift

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
